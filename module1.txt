					Software Testing Inroduction And Fundamentals
FUNDAMENTALS
*What is SDLC?

SDLC Stands for Software Development Life Cycle	is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality of
Software.
 
SDLC,is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.

The SDLC Model involves six phases or stages while developing any software.
1.Planning And Requirement Analysis
2.Defining Requirements
3.Design
4.Development
5.Testing
6.Deployment & Maintanance

*What is Software Testing?

Software testing is an important process in the software development lifecycle . 

It involves verifying and validating that a software application is free of bugs, meets the technical requirements set by its design 
and development , and satisfies user requirements efficiently and effectively.

*What is OOPS?
Object Oriented Programming Is a Programming Paradigm where we can create user defined datatypes or data structure.
OOPs is about creating objects that contains data and methods. 

*Write Basic Concepts Of OOPs.
1.Class
2.Objects		
3.Data Abstraction
4.Encapsulation
5.Inheritance
6.Polymorphism
7.Dynamic Binding
8.Message Passing

*What is Object?

Object is a basic unit of OOPs and represent the real life entities.

Object is a instance of a class.

When we create a class no memory is allocated but we create objects which allocate a memory 
An objects has a identity,state and behviour.

For example Dog is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, Breed, Bark, Sleep, and Eats.

*What is Class?
A class is collection of Objects.

It is User defined data types which contains data members and member functions which can be used and accessed by creating a instsnce 
of that class.

For example , consider the class of cars there may be many cars with diffrent names and brands but all of them share some same 
properties like 4wheels,colors,speedlimits,average,etc..
Here, Cars are class and colors,speed are its properties
